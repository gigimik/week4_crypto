RSA vs AES — Performance & Use Cases (Week 4)

RSA (asymmetric):
 - Uses a public/private key pair.
 - Much slower; suitable for encrypting small data or keys.
 - Commonly used for digital signatures and key exchange.

AES-256 (symmetric):
 - Uses one shared secret key.
 - Extremely fast; ideal for encrypting large files.
 - Used for real-time data encryption and storage security.

In practice:
 - Systems use RSA to protect a randomly generated AES key.
 - AES handles the bulk data encryption.
